        <p class="larger">Dear Git,</p>
        <br>
        <p>You’re like a gateway drug to me. So simple and sleek, but a passage to something much greater. </p>
        <br>
        <p>You had me at <em>git init</em>, when you stashed a hidden folder deep inside my heart. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I can always be sure that you’ll tell me exactly how it is when I run <em>git status</em>, and if anything in our relationship has changed, you let me <em>git add ___</em> or <em>git add ..</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>My favorite part of you, though I don’t know why, is your staging area. I can see everything that we’ve done together, and decide if I want to <em>git commit</em> with a cute <em>–m “message”</em> to remember it later.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I love that you keep a diary of everything we do, and you let me read it when I ask <em>git log</em>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>And when we decide we’re ready for the next step, we’ll get married by your friend, Github. I’ll say my vows, <em>git remote add origin _____</em>, and you’ll say yours. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I’ll spare the details, but you can be sure there’s some <em>git push</em> in store for us later. </p>
        <br>
