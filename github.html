	    <p class="larger">My dear Github,</p>
	    <br>
	    <p>I shouldn’t be writing this letter, but I just can’t help myself. Since the first time we met, when Git introduced me to you, I just haven’t been able to take my mind off of you.</p>
	    <br>
	    <p>Oh, I love the way you ask for my username and password once, but then don’t bother me with it again. I love your minimalistic user interface, and that strange octopus-looking logo for my account profile. I’m so drawn to the adventure of create new… > New Repository, that I just can’t stay away.</p>
	    <br>
	    <p>I’ll try to give the repository some funny name and description, and you always laugh at my stupid jokes. </p>
	    <br>
	    <p>You’ll hold my hand when I need it the most, and walk me through creating a new repository on the command line. Or when I’m feeling adventurous, you let me do my own thing and simply use the https address. </p>
	    <br>
	    <p>I happen to think it’s magical the way you show the contents of each repository in an easily accessible, readable format. </p>
	    <br>
	    <p>But I have to say, I’m sorry. I just don’t know how we could ever be together, just you and I, without your friend Git in the picture. </p>
