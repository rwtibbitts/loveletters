	    <p>Now that you’re terminal, I guess I should say all the thing that I wasn’t able to say before.</p>
	    <br>
        <p>You always seemed so grounded, so aware of where you are, when you use <em>pwd</em> to return the present working directory. </p>
	    <br>
        <p>You could always speak your mind and list exactly what was going on inside with <em>ls</em>.</p>
	    <br>
        <p>And better yet, you always knew how to get exactly where you want by typing <em>cd</em>. </p>
	    <br>
        <p>For example, there was the time you backed up with <em>cd ..</em>, the time we went home with <em>cd ~</em>, and who could forget the time we went allll the way back with <em>cd /</em>.</p>
	    <br>
        <p>I remember just how crafty with your hands. With a light <em>touch</em>, you could make a file. With a gentle <em>mkdir</em>, and entire folder. </p>
